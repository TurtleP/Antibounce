# Antibounce
_Originally A Ludum Dare #34 Game_

Bounce around and collect coins. The more coins, the better your score!

Collecting more also increases the game's speed.

- Watch out for the randomly spawning spikes and rockets which will hurt you.
- Hearts will spawn if your health drops below the max, but they will despawn after some time.
- Shields can spawn, although rarely. Grab one to protect yourself!

## Controls
Works with a controller and keyboard:
- Left Stick/WASD for movement
- Left/Right bumper/Q/E while holding a direction to Dash
